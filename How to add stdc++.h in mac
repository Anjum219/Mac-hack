At first, install gcc and copy the directory where gcc is installed.
The directiry can be checked using-

  $ gcc --version
  
It will return its installation directory. Go to that directory.

  $ cd /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin
  
Now run the commands from here-

  $ ../include
  $ sudo mkdir bits
  $ sudo chown user bits/
  
  Here user is your user name in the mac
  
  $ sudo chmod 777 bits/
  $ cd bits/
  $ touch stdc++.h
  
Now open this newly created file in TextEdit editor

  $ open -a TextEdit stdc++.h
  
Copy the content of https://github.com/Anjum219/Mac-hack/blob/main/stdc%2B%2B.h
and paste it in your file. Save it. Now you can include <bits/stdc++.h> in your 
cpp code.
